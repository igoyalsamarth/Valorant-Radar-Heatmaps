Lightningfast in attack was basically hungry for bath area(no pun), it was suicide to fight him for bath control. The truck/default plant area was his second favorite. B site was relatively less successful as he always ended up getting picked-off before the action began.

Trickey was most of the time alive post plant and had somewhat equal success on both sides, especially when the man reached A backside, he was unstoppable. Even on the B side, he had a great presence on B long and elbow side.

Lightningfast had great success during retakes from CT on the sides, while also pretty comfortably anchoring hooka for a lot of time. He was still, much more comfortably at the A site compared to the B site.

Trickey was playing the retake simulator in defense, the man most of the time found himself at CT of a site post plant and wasn't able to bring much impact in those situations. Also, the little redness in the outer bath area indicates he used to push and clear the area pretty often.
